# Competitive Edge Site Rebrand

## Brief

I'm looking for a new design for this single page site that contains 9 unique types of sections.  

### Design

The new theme to be created for the site is:

"Competitive Edge" - An Intense, driven, ambitious, strategic, bold site. Employ sharp, angular designs with high-contrast colors (e.g., green and gold). Target audience is teen athletes (ages 13-18) and their coaches in competitive team sports like high school soccer or basketball leagues.

## Project Files

This is a template for an existing static website published from a custom CMS.  All pages in this CMS are a combination of sections and it's in need of a full overhaul.  The goal is to replace existing CSS with a fresh, coherent theme using either HTML/vanillaCss or HTML/bootstrap.

### Technical

The HTML is based around a generated site and is highly consistent. The site is basically a series of interchangeable `section` tags inside of `main`. Each CSS file is focused on doing one thing, typically styling a single section. 

### Key Focus Areas

• A modern looking alternative to the existing site layout.
• Ensure to retain 2 adaptive levels (mobile and desktop) across modern browsers and mobile devices without altering core HTML markup.

### Deliverables

1. Create a new and unique visual interpretation of the single page site.
2. Update CSS theme files, following existing organization pattern.
3. (Optional) Update HTML if structural changes are required (e.g. if using bootstrap).
4. (Optional) Updated and/or new JavaScript files if required.
5. (Optional) Updated graphics either for icons or demo images.

Let me know your high-level concept, and an estimated timeline so we can set milestones and get this redesign underway. Successful completions could lead to more themes on this same structure.
